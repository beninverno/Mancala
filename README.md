# Mancala
Mancala Terminal Game

This is a two player Mancala application. The board currently prints as would be viewed by player one in a normal mancala game, with each value in the longer list representing a pit and the single-value list representing the capture pocket for each player. 

Each player takes their turn by entering the number of the pocket they would like to move. These values are an integer from 1-6 and are positioned differently for player one and two, as labeled.
